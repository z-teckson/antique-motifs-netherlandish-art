# Antique Motifs in Netherlandish Art: A Collaborative Database

This project aims to catalog instances where Netherlandish artists working in Rome, such as Adriaen de Vries, drew inspiration from specific antique sculptures. The data is stored in `database.csv` to facilitate computational analysis.

## CSV Columns

The `database.csv` file uses the following columns:

- `Artwork_Title`
- `Artist_Name`
- `Date_of_Work`
- `Antique_Source_Name`
- `Motif_Description`
- `Bibliographic_Reference`
